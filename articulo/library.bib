   abstract = {While reconstructing a car accident, there are several questions that must be answered, such as the movement of all the vehicles involved or of other people involved, or of objects from the point of first visual contact to their rest positions. Time history of velocities, positions as well as crash-related data such as velocity changes, deformation energies, or passenger loads must also be analysed. Methods to aid in accident reconstruction combine the simulation of pre-collision, collision, and post-collision dynamics for multiple vehicles. This paper presents trajectory and collision models used for accident reconstruction as well as useful optimisation strategies. The model for predicting the 3D kinematics of a vehicle's pre- and post-impact trajectory, which is based on a discrete kinetic time forward simulation of vehicle dynamics, has been described. The tyre model, steer angle, wheel braking, weight shift, and suspension effects have been introduced and a method of handling pre-impact yaw, braking, acceleration, and pre-impact steering have been outlined. The momentum-based collision model, which relies on restitution rather than vehicle crush or stiffness coefficients, has been defined and a method for dealing with secondary impacts, inter-vehicle friction, and impulse vectors with a vertical component have been explained. The second part of the paper deals with various collision models used to simulate the motion of the vehicles during the collision. Within the last part of the paper, various optimisation methods have been introduced which are used to generate the simulation results partially automated.},

   abstract = {In această lucrare se propun cateva modele matematice de reducere a corpurilor elementare la sisteme de puncte materiale cu aceleaşi proprietăţi de inerţie, astfel acestea vor avea: acelaşi centru de masă şi acelaşi tensor de inerţie. Plecând de la aceste modele, orice corp poate fi redus la un sistem de puncte materiale, iar determinarea proprietăţilor de inerţie devine mult mai simplă. De asemenea, corpurile reale au fost împărţite în patru clase, un aspect teoretic necesar pentru a explica modul în care se pot reduce corpurile. Această abordare de determinare a proprietăţilor de inerţie ale corpurilor este una nouă, neîntâlnită în nicio altă lucrare de specialitate. In this paper the author proposes some mathematical models of reduction of the elementary bodies to systems of material points with the same inertia properties, which means: the same centre of mass and the same tensor of inertia. Starting from these models, each body can be reduced to a system of material points and the possibility to calculate all these properties becomes easier. Also the real bodies were divided in four classes to make a better explication of the reduction method. The reduction operation is an original one. Keywords: centre of mass, reduction of a body, tensor of inertia, elementary body, order of body},

@report{Hogue,
   abstract = {Introduction Models using discrete elements require detail information of individual particle-particle contacts (Cundall and Strack, 1979; Drake and Shreve, 1986; Hogue and Newland, 1994; Walton, 1983). Although most models are only two dimensional, they also tend to be limited to modelling circular or elliptical particles. This is mainly due to the additional complexity, and thus additional computational requirements, which is most noticeable when running simulations of medium to large-scale systems, i.e. hundreds to thousands of particles per simulation. As a result, many computational models cannot directly address the problems which arise when dealing with assemblies of arbitrary particles (especially mixtures containing elongated-type bodies). Moreover, when extending models to three dimensions, the problem of collision detection of arbitrary shapes is greatly accentuated. This article compares several shape descriptors in two and three dimensions and their related techniques for contact detection. The aim is to find flexible shape descriptors which can represent a variety of arbitrary shapes within a single simulation, while allowing efficient and accurate collision detection between adjacent bodies to be performed.},

   abstract = {As a basic theory of the vehicle industry, the vehicle dynamics plays an important role in the development of the vehicle industry. In the past decades, great progress was made in the theory and experiment of vehicle dynamics. This article summarizes recent advances in vehicle dynamics. In vehicle dynamics, the vehicle body (sprung mass), the suspension component (spring and damper) and tire (unsprung mass) are essential parts of the system. The modeling approaches and characteristics of the vehicle, tire and driver model with the respect to handling and driving dynamics are summarized in the paper. The important research issues about the vehicle-pavement coupled dynamics are discussed in detail. Several problems and directions for the further studying in vehicle dynamics are pointed out.},
